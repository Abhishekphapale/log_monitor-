# Log Monitor

This Python script generates log messages at different levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) and writes them to a log file (`app.log`). It also provides basic log analysis functionality to count occurrences of specific keywords in the log file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.

2. Run the script using Python:

    ```bash
    python log_monitor.py [generate|analyze]
    ```

    - Use `generate` to generate log messages.
    - Use `analyze` to perform basic log analysis.

3. To stop log generation or analysis, press `Ctrl+C`.
